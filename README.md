This is a game I made to have fun with friends. It is NOT meant for public use. If you want to play it, you can, just don't hate me for not providing AAA game development.
It's a 2D ping pong/table tennis game called Isopong (isometric/ping-pong = iso/pong = isopong). Inspired by the ping pong minigame from Google Doodle Chamion Island.
